# Cycle 1 - Discrete Probability

We use **[BH]** in this cycle.

The notation for sections and problems is as follows: `chapter_number.section_number` for reading and `chapter_number.problem_number` for problems. Problems appear after the corresponding chapters.

When we list a range for reading or solving, the right bound is exclusive when we write "up to".

Examples:

1.6 (up to 1.6.3) -- 1.6.3 is excluded.

2.5.2-2.5.11 -- 2.5.11 is included.

## Chapter 1

Topics: naive probability, counting.
